library management system using c++
This C++ program implements a simple library management system where users can register, log in, view available books, search for books, borrow books, and return books. The program uses object-oriented programming concepts with a library class to handle book-related operations.

Features
User Registration and Login: Users can register with a username and password or log in if they already have an account.

Library Operations:

View all books
Search for books by title, author, or ISBN
Borrow books (with stock management)
Return books (with fine calculation for late returns)
Book Display: The program displays book details, including title, author, ISBN, and available stock.

Fine Calculation: If a user returns a book after the due date, a fine is imposed.

Visual Elements: The console interface is enhanced with a logo, decorative banners, and a user-friendly menu.

How to Use
Run the program.

Choose to register or log in.

If registering, provide a username and password.

If logging in, enter the username and password.

Access library operations from the main menu:

Press (1) to view all books.
Press (2) to search for books.
Press (3) to borrow a book.
Press (4) to return a book.
Press (0) to exit the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired operations.

Note
The program includes a predefined set of books for demonstration purposes.

The user passwords are not encrypted, and the program is designed for educational purposes rather than security.

The fine calculation is based on a fixed fine amount for late returns.

Feel free to customize or extend the program to add more features or improve functionality.
